I’m Bobby, I’m a software engineer based in Glasgow, Scotland. After working in financial services for 13 years i decided to pursue my passion and enrolled in [codeclan](https://codeclan.com/) - a coding boot camp based in Edinburgh.


Since completing Codeclan in January  2017, I’ve worked for a number of start ups primarily focused on fin tech. I’m currently employed as a Senior Developer at Soar, a small fin tech startup aiming to bring modern banking technology to credit unions.

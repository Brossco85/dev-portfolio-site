I’m Bobby, I’m a software engineer based in Glasgow, Scotland. After working in financial services for 13 years i decided to pursue my passion and enrolled in [codeclan](https://codeclan.com/) - a coding boot camp based in Edinburgh.


Since completing Codeclan in January 2017, I’ve worked for a number of start ups primarily focused on fin tech. I’m currently employed as a Senior Developer at Soar, a small fin tech startup aiming to bring modern banking technology to credit unions. I also work with a number of freelance clients to help bring their ideas to life.

In my spare time, i like to travel with my wife and dog, I’m a huge gamer and also love to read and learn what’s new in the Developer Community!

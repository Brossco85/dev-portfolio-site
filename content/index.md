But its not just software, who doesn’t love new tech? Being honest, I’m a bit of an Apple fanboy! I own pretty much all of apples current product line and will more often than not do my development on a mac although recently I’ve been turning to my iPad more and more for everything other than long coding sessions. i find a mac/iMac and an iPad Pro to be the perfect combination for my preferred workflow and i plan to create some posts on how i use both to boost my productivity.

During Lockdown i decided i wanted to set some challenges for myself to stay busy, and one thing i had set as a 2020 goal for myself was to work towards completing my AWS Certifications. After spending some time  studying which would be the best track to follow i decided to start with the developer associate exam as this is the most related to my day to day role. I do plan on completing the other associate level tracks but for now i will update on my progress.

I love to talk development and consider myself to be an approachable individual so if you have anything you think i might be able to help with or you have any interest in talking to me about a job or career advice feel free contact me on any of the platforms in the sidebar.

But its not just software, who doesn’t love new tech? Being honest, I’m a bit of an Apple fanboy! I own pretty much all of apples current product line and will more often than not do my development on a mac although recently I’ve been turning to my ipad more and more for everything other than long coding sessions. i find the combination of a mac/iMac and an iPad Pro to be the perfect combination for my preferred workflow and i plan to create some posts on how i use both to boost my productivity.

I love to talk development and consider myself to be an approachable individual so if you have anything you think i might be able to help with or you have any interest in talking to me about a job or career advice feel free contact me on any of the platforms in the sidebar.
